For the whatabook project the two parts I have submitted are:

whatabook_init.sql: This initialization script will delete any previous whatabook database and create a new one for my project submition.
The whatabook database differs from previous class examples in that the store table has an auto increment for the store_id and there is an 
added column to the table openHours for store hours.

whatabook.py: This is the program for users to access the database to view accounts and update their wishlist. Program requires initialization
script to be ran before executing. There are no additional depedancies need to run the program other than the MySQL Python driver that was  
used in pervious assignments.
